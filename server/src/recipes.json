Bake until the batter pulls away from the sides and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then flip the cakes out onto a cooling rack. Remove the parchment paper from the bottoms and flip the cakes back over. Let cool completely on the rack, about 1 hour."
